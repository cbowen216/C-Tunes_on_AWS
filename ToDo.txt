start with workshop 2
create docker compose container -
                
    Build schema model
    track with migration

    populate main tables with data
        users songs
            - populate with dummy data

            - fix the dummy data python file to get the record count and max, min record id for both users and songs.  right now you have to manually look up the user and song key min / max if you rewrote the database this code wiould not work

    create REST API end points at least 4
        - list users (index)
        - ensure you can connect to all tables using (index) end point
        - create user
        - update password
        - delete user
        - get list of user songs
        - get list albums of an artist
        - list album and songs for artist
